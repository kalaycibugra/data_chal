What can you do to improve agreement rates overtime?
-Evaluate success rate of each rater and eleminate them or assign them to less tasks. This will help us to get the most benefit from the
other raters.

How do you improve precision of a label overtime?
-Populate the dataset with more balanced data raher than random inputs

What changes are needed or required to improve your dataset to achieve over 90% agreement, precision, or
recall?
-Raters that cause less precision, recall or agreement should be discarded and new raters which have an agreement rate 90% should be hired.

Why do some raters perform better than others?
-Raters' functionalities and capabilities might be different or their there might be some unknown effects that effect their performance.
-Their montly performances might be effect their performances(for that we need a bigger dataset which has a year of data)


Identify 3 more potential questions to consider that can be used to identify issues among raters.

1-Does success rate change by time(weekly or daily)?
2-Are there any differences between raters' conditions?
3-Are there any evidence that shows us if there is a connection between a the amount of tasks a rater is doing daily and their success rate?
